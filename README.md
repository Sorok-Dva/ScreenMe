# ScreenMe - Screenshot Tool

ScreenMe is a simple screenshot tool built with C++ and Qt. It allows users to take screenshots and save them with auto-incremented filenames. The tool includes a system tray icon for easy access to the screenshot functionality and configurable hotkeys.
ScreenMe is designed for capturing, managing, and sharing screenshots efficiently. The application provides a range of functionalities to enhance the screenshot experience, from hotkey configurations to a built-in editor for annotating screenshots.

A website is available to register user captures online: [ScreenMe Website](https://screen-me.cloud).

### Why ScreenMe?
ScreenMe was created because of security concerns with Lightshot. There have been security vulnerabilities in Lightshot that allow anyone to view screenshots from other users. ScreenMe addresses this issue with robust privacy settings that ensure only you control who sees your screenshots.

Additionally, Lightshot has issues with Facebook login, resulting in users losing access to their galleries. ScreenMe offers reliable tools to migrate your screenshots from Lightshot to ScreenMe.

## Features

- Capture full screen or selected area screenshots
- Annotate screenshots with text, shapes, and drawing tools
- Save screenshots in multiple formats (PNG, JPEG)
- Hotkey support for quick access to screenshot functionalities
- System tray integration for easy access
- Online synchronization of screenshots (requires login)
- Configurable options for image quality and file saving
